                    We can supply a producer, camera operator, sound recordist
                    or any other specialist crew you need to complete your team.
                    We do not insist on producing your shoot if your requirement
                    is merely locations or crew. At Crew Connector we simply
                    want the best for your production by providing you access to
                    some of the best crew & locations that will truly fulfill
                    all your needs.

                    At Crew Connector we list crew in photography, TV & film for
                    all productions. Having worked as director, cameraman,
                    editor and producer, we truly understand the life of a crew
                    member, the challenges faced, as well as the rewards. It's
                    these experiences that encouraged us to build a creative
                    crew Connector community created â€˜by the people, for the
                    people.
