                    <p>
                        At Crew Connector we list crew in photography, TV & film
                        for all productions. Having worked as director,
                        cameraman, editor and producer, we truly understand the
                        life of a crew member, the challenges faced, as well as
                        the rewards. It's these experiences that encouraged us
                        to build a creative crew Connector community created â€˜by
                        the people, for the people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can supply a producer, camera operator, sound
                        recordist or any other specialist crew you need to
                        complete your team. We do not insist on producing your
                        shoot if your requirement is merely locations or crew.
                        At Crew Connector we simply want the best for your
                        production by providing you access to some of the best
                        crew & locations that will truly fulfill all your needs.
