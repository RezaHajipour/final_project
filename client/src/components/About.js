                    Crew Connector is a App to connect Film and TV Crew. In this
                    App users can either register themselves as a crew either
                    search for a crew for their project. The search can be done
                    by title, category or location.

                    From 10th January to 1st April 2022 I participated Fullstack
                    Developer Bootcamp at Spiced Academy. Thanks to their
                    teaching methods, now I am able to create a web App both in
                    Backend and Frontend. Crew Connector is a my final Project
                    and made in last week of bootcamp(25th March - 1st April
                    2022).

                    Diego Caponera was my coach in this course.This was a tough
                    Bootcamp, but you got me through it! My gratitude to you for
                    all you have done, which I will never forget. I truly
                    appreciate you and your time you spent helping me in many
                    occasions.
